## Journal Entry — System Alignment & Team Workflow Upgrade

**Date:** Tonight

### What We Accomplished

Today we finalized a major shift in how development decisions are made and executed for HireNowPro.

* Established a **Tri‑Team workflow**:

  * **Alfie (CEO / Vision & Decisions)** — defines intent, priorities, and approvals.
  * **Sol (Planner / Architect)** — validates reasoning, manages risk, consolidates feedback.
  * **Codex (Engineer)** — executes only after assumptions and scope are confirmed.

* Formalized a **clarification‑first Codex process**:

  * Codex must infer the system cautiously, list assumptions, identify risks, and ask questions **before** implementation.
  * Implementation only begins after explicit approval.

* Successfully completed the **first clarification loop** for the post‑interview email system:

  * Confirmed PASS / REVIEW / FAIL belongs to **Interview**, not InterviewResult.
  * Preserved existing hire/reject semantics.
  * Locked email flow as **semi‑automated, HR‑triggered only**.
  * Approved audit logging, compliance rules, and template strategy.

* Reduced the need to paste large code files by shifting to **decision‑driven coordination**.

### Observations

* Reading is no longer a burden because it now serves a **clear goal**.
* Fast reading and selective depth are being used effectively.
* Energy is conserved by deciding first, coding second.

### Outcome

HireNowPro moved from “AI scoring tool” thinking to a **true hiring workflow platform** mindset.
The system is now protected from silent breaking changes and premature automation.

### Next Steps (Tomorrow)

* Test the implemented email decision flow.
* Verify HR UI behavior and send‑once protections.
* Review logs and audit entries after test emails.

**Status:** Stable. Aligned. Ready for testing.
