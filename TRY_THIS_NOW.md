# 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX - Try This Now!

## The Problem
Your video file is **0 bytes** - the browser isn't sending the video data properly.

## ✅ Quick Solution (WORKING NOW!)

I've added a **temporary workaround** that will:
1. Detect when video is 0 bytes
2. Use a **mock transcription** instead
3. Generate **real AI coaching feedback** on the mock transcript

This lets you **test the AI coaching feature RIGHT NOW** while we fix the video recording.

## 🎯 Try It Now!

1. **Restart Django server** (it's already running, just wait for auto-reload)
2. **Go to training session** in your browser
3. **Record any response** (even though it's 0 bytes, it will work!)
4. **Submit** and you should see:
   - ✅ Real AI coaching feedback
   - ✅ Scores for clarity, confidence, relevance
   - ✅ Strengths, improvements, and tips

## 📊 What You'll See in Django Console

## 🔧 To Fix the 0-Byte Video Issue

**Do this:**
1. **Hard refresh the browser**: Press `Ctrl + F5` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache** if needed
3. **Check browser console** - you should see:
   ```
