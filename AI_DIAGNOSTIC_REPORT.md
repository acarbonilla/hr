# AI Training Analysis - Diagnostic Report

## ✅ API Key Status: WORKING

The Gemini API key is properly configured and functional:
- **API Key**: `AIzaSyBw-xn4p_G7W4Sq...` (configured in `.env`)
- **Status**: ✅ Verified working with test script
- **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash`

## 🔍 What Was Changed

### Backend Improvements (`backend/training/views.py`)

1. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - Added detailed logging at each step (AI service init, transcription, feedback generation)
   - Shows file path, size, and existence checks
   - Separates transcription errors from feedback generation errors
   - Provides full stack traces for debugging

2. **Better Error Messages**
   - Specific error messages based on failure type:
     - Transcription failures → "Could not transcribe audio from video. Please check your microphone."
     - API/Key issues → "AI service configuration issue. Please contact support."
     - Timeouts → "Processing timeout. Please try with a shorter video."
   - Includes error type in response for frontend display

### Frontend Improvements (`frontend/app/training/session/[id]/page.tsx`)

1. **Enhanced Error Display**
   - Shows detailed error information including error type
   - Displays technical error details in a monospace box for debugging
   - Maintains user-friendly error messages

2. **Type Safety** (`frontend/types/index.ts`)
   - Added `error` and `error_type` fields to `TrainingResponse.ai_feedback`

## 🎯 Next Steps to Diagnose the Issue

Now that we have better logging, please try the following:

1. **Record a new training response** in the browser
2. **Check the Django console** (the terminal running `py manage.py runserver`)
3. **Look for the detailed logs** that will now show:
   ```
   🔧 Initializing AI service...
   ✓ AI service initialized successfully
   🎤 Starting video transcription...
     - Video path: [path]
     - File exists: True/False
     - File size: [size] bytes
   ```

4. **Share the error output** - The logs will tell us exactly where it's failing:
   - If it fails at "Initializing AI service" → API key issue (unlikely since we tested it)
   - If it fails at "Transcribing video" → Video file or Gemini transcription issue
   - If it fails at "Generating coaching feedback" → AI analysis issue

## 🔧 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: No Audio Detected
**Symptoms**: Error mentions "transcription" or "no audio"
**Solution**: 
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Ensure you're speaking during recording
- Test microphone with browser's built-in test

### Issue 2: Video File Not Found
**Symptoms**: "File exists: False" in logs
**Solution**:
- Check `MEDIA_ROOT` setting in Django
- Ensure media directory has write permissions
- Verify video is being uploaded correctly

### Issue 3: Gemini API Rate Limit
**Symptoms**: Error mentions "quota" or "rate limit"
**Solution**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check Gemini API quota in Google Cloud Console

### Issue 4: Video Format Issue
**Symptoms**: Gemini can't process the video file
**Solution**:
- Ensure video is in WebM format
- Check video file isn't corrupted
- Try with a shorter recording

## 📊 How to Read the New Error Messages

The frontend will now show errors like this:

```
Analysis Issue
We couldn't analyze your response...

Error: Exception - Transcription failed: Video processing timeout
```

The format is: `Error: [ErrorType] - [Detailed Message]`

This will help us pinpoint exactly what's going wrong!
