# Gemini 3 Pro Limitations & Considerations

## Overview

If you're considering using **Gemini 3 Pro** instead of Gemini 2.5 Flash, be aware of the following limitations and potential expiration concerns.

## Current Limitations (as of late 2025)

### 1. **Usage Quotas & Access**

- **Free Tier**: 
  - "Basic access" with **fluctuating daily limits** based on system demand
  - Previously fixed at ~5 prompts/day, now varies
  - Not suitable for production applications with consistent load
  
- **Paid Tier**:
  - Higher quotas but more expensive
  - Cost per token is higher than Gemini 2.5 Flash
  - Better for production but increases operational costs

### 2. **Model Expiration/Deprecation**

- **Important**: Google has a history of deprecating older Gemini models
- Gemini 3 Pro hasn't been announced for retirement yet, but **future deprecation is likely**
- Previous models (e.g., Gemini 2.0, Gemini 1.5) had defined retirement dates
- **Risk**: Your application could break if the model is deprecated without notice

### 3. **API Rate Limits**

- Stricter rate limits compared to stable models
- Quota errors can occur during high-demand periods
- Need robust error handling and retry logic

## Recommendations for Your Application

### ✅ **Current Setup (Recommended for Production)**

Your application currently uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, which is:

- ✅ **Stable** - Well-tested and reliable
- ✅ **Cost-effective** - Lower pricing than Pro models
- ✅ **Good quotas** - Consistent access without major limitations
- ✅ **Production-ready** - No expiration concerns in near term

**Keep this for production interviews.**

### 🔬 **If You Want to Test Gemini 3 Pro**

Consider these modifications:

#### Option 1: Make Model Configurable (Recommended)

Add model selection via environment variable with fallback:

```python
# backend/core/settings.py
GEMINI_MODEL_NAME = os.getenv('GEMINI_MODEL_NAME', 'gemini-2.5-flash')  # Default to stable
GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL = 'gemini-2.5-flash'  # Always have fallback
```

#### Option 2: Add Quota Error Handling

Handle quota/rate limit errors gracefully:

```python
# In ai_service.py
try:
    response = self.model.generate_content(...)
except google.api_core.exceptions.ResourceExhausted as e:
    # Quota exceeded - use fallback model
    print(f"⚠️ Quota exceeded, falling back to {GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL}")
    fallback_model = genai.GenerativeModel(GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL)
    response = fallback_model.generate_content(...)
except google.api_core.exceptions.NotFound as e:
    # Model deprecated/not found
    print(f"⚠️ Model not available, using fallback")
    fallback_model = genai.GenerativeModel(GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL)
    response = fallback_model.generate_content(...)
```

## Model Comparison

| Feature | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Gemini 3 Pro |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| **Stability** | ✅ Stable | ⚠️ Newer, less proven |
| **Cost** | 💰 Lower | 💰💰 Higher |
| **Speed** | ⚡ Fast | 🐢 Slower |
| **Quality** | ✅ Good | ✅✅ Better |
| **Quotas** | ✅ Consistent | ⚠️ Variable (free tier) |
| **Expiration Risk** | ✅ Low | ⚠️ Unknown |

## Best Practices

1. **Production**: Use **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (current setup)
2. **Testing/Development**: Can experiment with Gemini 3 Pro
3. **Always have fallback**: Never hardcode a single model
4. **Monitor quotas**: Track usage to avoid surprises
5. **Watch for deprecation notices**: Google announces model retirements

## Implementation Checklist

If switching to Gemini 3 Pro:

- [ ] Set up environment variable for model selection
- [ ] Implement fallback to stable model
- [ ] Add quota error handling
- [ ] Monitor token usage and costs
- [ ] Test thoroughly before production
- [ ] Set up alerts for quota limits
- [ ] Document model selection in deployment config

## Current Codebase Location

AI Service: `backend/interviews/ai_service.py`
- Currently uses: `gemini-2.5-flash` (line 24)
- Configuration: Hardcoded (consider making configurable)

Settings: `backend/core/settings.py`
- API Key: Configured (line 228)
- Model selection: Not yet configurable

## Conclusion

**For your production interview analysis application**, stick with **Gemini 2.5 Flash** until:

1. Gemini 3 Pro proves stable over time
2. You need the enhanced capabilities
3. Cost increases are acceptable
4. Quota limitations are resolved

The current setup is optimal for reliability and cost-effectiveness! 🎯
