# HR Review Queue - User Guide

## What Changed?

The HR Review Queue now **only shows applicants that need your attention**. Once you make a final decision (Hire or Reject), the applicant is automatically removed from the queue.

## Who Shows Up in the Review Queue?

### ✅ You WILL See:

- **Scores 50-74.9**: These are in the "review range" - AI can't decide automatically
- **Scores 40-49.9**: Borderline fails that you might want to review
- **No final decision made yet**: You haven't hired or rejected them

### ❌ You WON'T See:

- **Scores 75+**: Clear passes (you can still find them in "Interview Results")
- **Scores below 40**: Clear fails (already marked as failed)
- **Already decided**: Anyone you've hired or rejected

## How to Review an Applicant

### Step 1: Access the Review Queue

1. Log into HR Dashboard
2. Click "HR Review Queue" in the sidebar
3. You'll see a list of applicants needing review

### Step 2: Review the Interview

1. Click "Review Details" button next to an applicant
2. Watch video responses and read transcripts
3. Check AI scores and assessments
4. Override individual question scores if needed (optional)

### Step 3: Make Final Decision

At the top of the review page, you'll see two buttons:

#### 🟢 Hire Applicant

- Click this if you want to hire them
- Add optional notes about why you're hiring them
- Confirm the decision
- Applicant status changes to "Hired"
- Removed from review queue

#### 🔴 Reject Applicant

## Understanding the Statistics

At the top of the Review Queue page, you'll see three cards:

### Pending Reviews

- **Orange card**: Total number of applicants waiting for your decision
- This is your "to-do list"

### Urgent (3+ days)

- **Red card**: Applicants who have been waiting 3+ days
- Review these first to avoid delays

### Reviewed Today

- **Green card**: Number of decisions you've made today
- Currently set to 0 (feature coming soon)

## Priority Badges

Some applicants have priority badges:

- **🚨 Urgent (red badge)**: Waiting 3+ days - review ASAP
- **No badge**: Normal priority

## Filters

Use the filters to narrow down the list:

- **Review Status**: Toggle between pending and reviewed (coming soon)
- **Priority**: Show only urgent cases or all cases
- **Position**: Filter by job position
- **Date Range**: See applicants from specific dates

## Tips for Efficient Reviewing

1. **Start with Urgent**: Handle 3+ day old reviews first
2. **Watch Videos**: Don't rely only on AI scores
3. **Check Transcripts**: Verify what was actually said
4. **Trust Your Judgment**: Override AI scores when needed
5. **Add Notes**: Document your decision reasoning
6. **Decide Quickly**: Don't leave applicants waiting

## FAQ

### Q: What if I make a mistake?

A: Contact your system administrator. They can reverse decisions in the admin panel.

### Q: Can I see applicants I already decided on?

A: Yes! Go to "Interview Results" page and filter by final decision status.

### Q: Why don't I see high-scoring applicants (75+)?

A: They're considered clear passes. The system assumes you'll hire them. You can still review them in "Interview Results" if needed.

### Q: What about very low scores (below 40)?

A: They're automatically failed. No review needed. Focus on the borderline cases.

### Q: Can I un-hire or un-reject someone?

A: Not from the interface. Contact your admin for special cases.

### Q: What if an applicant seems suspicious (script reading)?

A: Use the "Authenticity Check" feature (if you see a flag). You can confirm the issue, clear the flag, or request a walk-in re-interview.
